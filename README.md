# Cigar Bar

Cigar Bar is a single-page app developed using HTML, CSS, and javascript as the front end. And a ruby on rails API for the back end. The app is used to track stats on cigars that a user has tried/purchased. A can view all cigars that are saved to the database. The user can also view all styles of cigars, along with all saved cigars that belong to that style. Finally, the user has the ability to add new cigars to the database.  

## Installation

After the the repository is cloned, you will need to cd into the backend directory. You will then need to install all the gem dependencies and run rails db:seed to initialize the api with starter data. Then start the rails servers to access the API data. Once the API is running, load the HTML page in the frontend directory into your browser.

```bash
bundle install
```
